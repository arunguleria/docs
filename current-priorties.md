# Current priorties

## Priorities

1. **Keep** _**everything**_ **simple** We are slipping a bit. Dashboards aren't simple. We're adding a lot of features
2. **Wide deployments that work** e.g. Training materials/videos, scaleable customer support.
3. **Dashboards that deliver great feedback loops** We're at about 0.1 here... need to get to 1.0 in a few months 
4. **Interoperability** Take first concrete steps with local partners
5. **Reduce lost-to-follow-up rates** e.g. Text messages, overdue list improvements, WhatsApp, etc
6. **Next country...**  Be prepared for another country deployment later this year
7. **Designing for Diabetes \(DM\) support** Exploration is prioritized, not development yet.
8. **Become more welcoming as an open source project**

   Keep moving towards welcoming outside contributors \(better documentation, openness, etc\)

## Back-burner

* Engineering diabetes \(DM\) support in the app
* Support for screening pre-hypertensive and undiagnosed patients
* Telemedicine
* Clinical decision support system \(CDSS\)
* Facility self-registration
