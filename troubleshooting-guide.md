## **Issues**

### **1. "I am not able to find a patient"**

* Make sure to match patient details - \(full name, age, address, last visit date\) to check if patient is already registered. 
* Enter full name \(First name + last name\) for e.g type 'Parminder Kaur Ahluwalia'
* Ask the patient if they have already been registered at the same or different facility.

### 2. "I have duplicate patients"

* Inform the users that we are working on a solution to remove duplicates from the system.

### 3. "I recorded a patient at the wrong facility"
